# **The Feedback App**

## **Overview**

The "feedback app" is a nice little project built for training on creating or client-side project with **React**, and also revise and deal with the basics of **CRUD** operations. <br>
The "feedbacks" are added in the form of some "cards" (Which is a shared component) that we can delete or update if we have some regrets on what we said. <br>
**package.json** reveals that I used the mock **json-server** to be able to "mock" a backend, my data being sent/retrieved on localhost:5000. <br>
Pretty enjoyable project, with a nice "design and colors" that you can git clone and play with.

Once git-cloned, you can run **npm run dev** in the root folder of the project. **db.json** contains only two feedbacks, you can hardcode anything else or nothing. It will get upated along as you **CRUD-play** on the UI.
